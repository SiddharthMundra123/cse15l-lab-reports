# Lab report 5
For this lab report, I decided to return to lab report number 3 and explore a command similar to grep. I decided to research about find, which has a similar purpose to the grep command. The “find” command is used to find, filter, or search files and folders in your system according to user-specified conditions and perform several operations on them. The following are 4 interesting command-line options about the find command - 
* -name * : this command is used to find files with the same extension (.txt .pdf etc).
* -empty : this command is used to find all empty folders in the given directory.
* -iname : this command is used to find files using their name while ignoring case
* -exec wc : this command prints the number of matching words in a file

I found all of these on https://www.tecmint.com/35-practical-examples-of-linux-find-command/. Below are the examples of using these commands

## Command 1: -name *
**Example 1**

## Command 2: -empty

## Command 3: -iname
