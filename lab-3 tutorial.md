# Lab report 3
In this lab report, we are required to research about a specific command. I chose to research about the grep command. The following are 4 interesting command-line options about the grep command - 
* -i : this command is used to ignore capitalizaitions while searching for a match.
* -c : this command prints a count of matching lines for each input file
* -h : this command is an indicaor to print the file name as well for each match.
* -x
* -color

I found all of these on https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html. Below are the examples of using these commands.
## Command 1: -i
